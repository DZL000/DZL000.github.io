      <description>Something about me and this blog This post is to give some brief description about myself as well as my blog.
My name is David, I&#39;m currently undertaking a bachelor degree in a university located in New South Walse, Australia. My majors are physics and computer science. I do have strong interest in quantum physics and artifical intellignece as well as philosophy.
This blog is to share some of my chaotic (nothing is truly random) thoughts as well as things which are elated to my works and projects.</description>
